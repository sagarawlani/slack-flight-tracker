Slack slash command bot to track status of the flights

One day I needed to track a delayed flight before heading to the airport and decided to hack a simple Slack slash-command flight tracker bot. It scrapes Google search results and outputs it directly as a Slackbot response in any Slack channel. I know it's a very hacky way and scraping may get broken at some point.

Using http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/ for parsing.
